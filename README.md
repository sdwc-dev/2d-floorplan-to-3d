## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blender Dependency

- For advanced 3D boolean operations (cutting wall openings for doors/windows), the app tries to use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
- **If Blender is not available** (e.g., on Streamlit Cloud), the app will use a slower fallback engine and show a warning. The app will still work, but some 3D features may be less accurate for complex floorplans.

## üìù Notes

- Make sure `best.pt`, `door.obj`, and `window.obj` are present in your project directory.
- The app supports both detection-based and rule-based wall generation.
- You can customize colors and download the generated 3D models.
